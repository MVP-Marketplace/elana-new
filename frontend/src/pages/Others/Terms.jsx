					practicing independently of the service with a range of credentials. We do not practice medicine or any other licensed profession, and do 
					not interfere with the practice of medicine or any other licensed or not-licensed profession by Providers, each of whom is responsible for his

					<h5>DISCLAIMER</h5>
					<br />
					<br /> 
					<span className="smallprnt1">Members</span>
					<br />
					<br />
					We created Elana to improve Members healthcare experience starting with women with pelvic health issues, and we strive to create an 
					exceptional user experience. While we work hard to make that happen, you acknowledge that we have no control over, and no duty to take 
					any action regarding: (a) which members gain access to the Site and/or the Services, (b) what Content you access, (c) what effects the 
					Content may have on you, (d) how you may interpret or use the Content, or (e) what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed 
					to the Content. While we seek to match our members with providers that match the care style they are looking for (including, but not 
					limited to, preferences such as: communication style, budget restrictions, tendency toward “traditional” care vs. “non-traditional” methods, 
					treatment methods, provider credentials) we do not accept liability for the healthcare decisions that members make and Elana’s 
					suggested matches are not medical recommendations.
					<br></br>
					<br></br> 
					You release us from all liability for you having acquired, you having not acquired, or your use of Content. We make no representations or 
					warranties regarding suggestions or recommendations of services or products offered or purchased through the Site and/or the Services. 
					We have no special relationship with or fiduciary duty to you.
					<br />
					<br /> 
					<h5>Providers</h5>
					<br />
					<br /> 
					In addition to providing the Service for our members, we have Providers as part of our network. Any new Provider signing up to the Service 
					must agree to abide by the Service’s “Provider Pledge” found on our website.
					<br></br>
					<br></br> 
					All Providers must (a) have the ability to provide virtual consultations and acknowledge that they are responsible for the specific telehealth 
					regulations that apply to them based on their type of business, credentials, and practice location, including but not limited to the ability to 
					practice with members across applicable geographical boundaries (e.g., including but not limited to state, province, and country lines); (b) 
					offer, at minimum, a free 15-minute “discovery” call to all matches made through the Service, (c) agree to provide proof of their credentials 
					when asked, (d) acknowledge that liability coverage for their own business or practice, including but not limited to malpractice insurance, 
					is required to join the Elana network and subsequently agree to provide proof of their insurance if and when asked. 
					<br />
                    <br />
					The Service is not responsible for any Provider who may fail to comply with these Terms, and reserves the right to terminate use of the 
					Service if it is found that a Provider has joined the directory that is not practicing according to the Provider Pledge or items A through D 
					listed above.
					<br />
                    <br />
					The Providers utilizing or featured on the Service are subscribers to and licensees of the Service and not employees of Elana. Any opinions,
					advice, or information expressed by a Provider on the Service are of the facility, professional or specialist alone. They do not reflect
					the opinions of Elana. Elana does not recommend or endorse any specific tests, providers, products, procedures, medications, devices,
					opinions, or other information that may be mentioned on any medium of the Service by a Provider.

					endorsement of such Provider nor is such information intended as a tool for verifying the credentials, qualifications, or abilities of any
					Provider contained therein. Such information is provided on an “as-is” basis and Elana disclaims all warranties either express or implied.
					<br />

					Service user) in reliance on information about Providers on the Service. The use of the Service by any entity or individual to verify the
					credentials of Practitioners is prohibited.
					<br />

					booked through the Service. This fee is subject to change without notice.
